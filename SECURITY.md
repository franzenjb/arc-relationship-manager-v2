# SECURITY DOCUMENTATION

## üîê **SECURITY UPDATE - January 25, 2025**

**REGION-BASED PASSWORD AUTHENTICATION NOW AVAILABLE (BETA)**

## Current Security Status (January 25, 2025)

### **What IS Secure:**
- ‚úÖ Database connection uses secure HTTPS/WSS
- ‚úÖ API keys are properly configured
- ‚úÖ Service role key is protected in environment variables
- ‚úÖ SSL/TLS encryption for all data transmission
- ‚úÖ Vercel hosting provides DDoS protection

### **What IS Partially Secure (NEW):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **REGION PASSWORD LOGIN** - Basic password protection available at /login
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **SESSION TRACKING** - Browser session tracks region and user name
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **REGION ISOLATION** - Can filter data by region (not yet implemented)

### **What IS NOT YET Secure:**
- ‚ùå **NOT ENFORCED** - Direct URLs still bypass login (gradual rollout)
- ‚ùå **NO INDIVIDUAL USERS** - Shared passwords per region
- ‚ùå **NO REAL AUDIT LOGGING** - Still uses placeholder user
- ‚ùå **NO DATA ENCRYPTION** - Database content not encrypted at rest
- ‚ùå **LIMITED ACCESS CONTROL** - No role-based permissions yet

## Why Authentication Was Removed

**Date:** October 23, 2024  
**Reason:** Emergency fix for executive demonstration at 11:00 AM  
**Issue:** Authentication system was blocking critical functionality  
**Decision:** Temporarily bypass authentication to ensure demo success  
**Result:** System has operated without authentication since October 2024  

## Security Implications

### **Data at Risk:**
1. **Organization Information**
   - Partner organization details
   - Contact information
   - Relationship strategies
   - Internal notes and assessments

2. **Personal Information**
   - Names, emails, phone numbers
   - Job titles and affiliations
   - Meeting attendance records

3. **Operational Intelligence**
   - Meeting agendas and notes
   - Follow-up actions
   - Strategic partnerships
   - Regional coordination plans

### **Compliance Issues:**
- May violate Red Cross data protection policies
- Potential PII (Personally Identifiable Information) exposure
- No compliance with access control requirements
- Audit trail requirements not met

## Temporary Security Measures

Until authentication is implemented:

1. **Limit URL Distribution**
   - Only share URL with authorized Red Cross personnel
   - Do not post URL in public forums
   - Do not include URL in public documentation

2. **Monitor Access**
   - Regular review of Vercel access logs
   - Monitor for unusual activity
   - Check database for unauthorized changes

3. **Data Minimization**
   - Avoid entering sensitive information
   - Use generic descriptions where possible
   - Regular data cleanup

## Authentication Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Basic Authentication (URGENT)**
```typescript
// Planned implementation using Supabase Auth
const { data: user, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
  email: 'user@redcross.org',
  password: 'secure-password'
})
```

**Components to Add:**
- `/app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Login page
- `/app/auth/logout/route.ts` - Logout handler
- `/middleware.ts` - Route protection
- `/components/auth/auth-guard.tsx` - Component wrapper

### **Phase 2: Row Level Security**
```sql
-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE organizations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE people ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE meetings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their chapter's data" ON organizations
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() IN (
    SELECT user_id FROM user_chapters WHERE chapter_id = organizations.chapter_id
  ));
```

### **Phase 3: Role-Based Access Control**

**Planned Roles:**
- `super_admin` - Full system access
- `regional_admin` - Regional data access
- `chapter_admin` - Chapter data access
- `chapter_user` - Read/write for assigned chapter
- `viewer` - Read-only access

## Security Checklist for Production

Before moving to production, complete ALL items:

- [ ] Implement user authentication (email/password minimum)
- [ ] Add session management with timeout
- [ ] Enable Row Level Security on all tables
- [ ] Implement role-based access control
- [ ] Add audit logging for all changes
- [ ] Set up automated backups
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add CAPTCHA for public forms
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Conduct security audit
- [ ] Obtain security approval from Red Cross IT

## Incident Response

If unauthorized access is suspected:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Change all API keys
   - Review recent database changes
   - Export audit logs
   - Notify Red Cross IT Security

2. **Investigation:**
   - Check Vercel access logs
   - Review database activity
   - Identify affected data
   - Document timeline

3. **Remediation:**
   - Revert unauthorized changes
   - Implement authentication immediately
   - Update all credentials
   - Notify affected stakeholders

## Contact for Security Issues

**Security concerns should be reported to:**
- Jeff Franzen: Jeff.Franzen2@redcross.org
- Red Cross IT Security: [IT Security Contact]
- Emergency: 703-957-5711

## Authentication Configuration

When ready to implement authentication:

```env
# Add to .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key

# Future additions needed:
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=generate-secret-key
SMTP_HOST=smtp.server.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=email@redcross.org
SMTP_PASSWORD=email-password
```
